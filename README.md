# Payroll Data Extraction - Schema Complete ✅

## What We've Done

1. **Analyzed your sample PDFs** - Extracted and examined PR-Register.pdf structure
2. **Converted global schema** - From JSON (v2) to Python dict format
3. **Enhanced the schema** - Added 10+ improvements based on real payroll data
4. **Created documentation** - Comprehensive guides and examples

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [schemas/global_schema.py](schemas/global_schema.py) | **Main schema** - Import and use in code |
| [SCHEMA_SUMMARY.md](SCHEMA_SUMMARY.md) | Changes from v2, improvements overview |
| [SCHEMA_MAPPING_EXAMPLE.md](SCHEMA_MAPPING_EXAMPLE.md) | Real examples from sample PDF |
| [SCHEMA_REVIEW.md](SCHEMA_REVIEW.md) | **READ THIS** - Final recommendations |

## Schema Highlights

### Structure
```
metadata (report info, employer, pay period)
└── employees[] (array)
    ├── employee_info (name, ID, tax profile)
    ├── payment_info (check/DD, check number)
    ├── earnings (lines + totals)
    ├── employee_taxes (lines + totals)
    ├── deductions (lines + totals)
    ├── net_pay
    └── employee_totals
└── rollups
    ├── department_totals[]
    └── company_totals (earnings, taxes, deductions, grand totals)
```

### Key Features
- ✅ Both **Current** and **YTD** values everywhere
- ✅ **Confidence scores** for quality tracking
- ✅ **Normalized types** + raw labels preserved
- ✅ Supports multiple employees per report
- ✅ **FIELD_ALIASES** dictionary for intelligent mapping
- ✅ Comprehensive earning/tax/deduction categories

### Supported Elements

**Earnings**: Regular, Overtime, Vacation, Sick, Holiday, Bonus, Commission  
**Taxes**: Federal WH, OASDI, Medicare, State WH, Local, SDI  
**Deductions**: 401k, Health/Dental/Vision, FSA/HSA, Child Support, Tax Levy  
**Payment**: Check, Direct Deposit (DD), Cash  

## Sample Data Coverage

✅ All elements from **PR-Register.pdf** are covered:
- Multiple employees (14 employees across 2 pages)
- Various earning types (Regular, Vacation, Sick, Bonus)
- Multiple deductions (401k, Medical, Dental, Child Support, Tax Levy)
- All tax types (Federal, OASDI, Medicare, State)
- Employee metadata (name, ID, SSN, dept, tax status)
- Report metadata (pay period, payroll #, company name)

## Next Steps

### READY TO PROCEED? 
If schema looks good → I'll build the extraction pipeline:
1. Project structure (main.py, src/, prompts/)
2. Pass 1: Raw extraction prompt + code
3. Pass 2: Schema mapping prompt + code
4. Validation logic
5. Test with your PDFs

### NEED CHANGES?
Review [SCHEMA_REVIEW.md](SCHEMA_REVIEW.md) and let me know:
- Missing fields?
- Different structure?
- Additional requirements?

## Quick Start (Once Pipeline is Built)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set API key
# Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env file

# Run extraction
python main.py sample_pdfs/PR-Register.pdf

# Output will be in:
outputs/PR-Register/
  ├── extracted.json    # Raw PDF text
  ├── interim.json      # Pass 1: Raw extraction
  ├── mapped.json       # Pass 2: Mapped to schema
  └── final.json        # Validated output
```

---

**Status**: 🟢 Schema finalized and ready  
**Waiting for**: Your review and approval to proceed with pipeline development
